Developed a deep learning model (InceptionV3) for early-stage lung cancer detection using histopathological images.
Trained on 15,000 augmented images, achieving 94% accuracy in classification of lung tissue types.
Implemented transfer learning to enhance feature extraction and model efficiency.
Built a web-based system (Flask) for real-time automated lung cancer prediction.
Applied Python (TensorFlow/Keras) for model development and performance optimisation.
Focused on medical AI applications, ensuring high generalisation and clinical relevance.
